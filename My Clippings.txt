“In a society where mediocrity is too often the standard and too often rewarded,” he said, “there is intense fascination with men who detest mediocrity, who refuse to define themselves in conventional terms, and who seek to transcend traditionally recognized human capabilities. This is exactly the type of person BUD/S is meant to find. The man who finds a way to complete each and every task to the best of his ability. The man who will adapt and overcome any and all obstacles.”

Chris Kyle. You know him as the deadliest sniper in Navy history. He was so successful, the hajjis in Fallujah put an $80,000 bounty on his head and he became a living legend among the Marines he protected as a member of SEAL Team Three. He won a Silver Star and four Bronze Stars for valor, left the military, and wrote a book, American Sniper, that became a hit movie starring Bradley fucking Cooper.

Maybe you are tackling a hundred-question test and know that you’ve bricked the first fifty. At that point, it’s extremely difficult to maintain the necessary discipline to force yourself to keep taking the test seriously. It’s also imperative that you find it because in every failure there is something to be gained, even if it’s only practice for the next test you’ll have to take. Because that next test is coming. That’s a guarantee.

However, taking a principle from one context, such as economics, and applying it uncritically and blindly to another context—bodybuilding in this case—is to commit the logical fallacy of context switching, and in this instance, lacking both consistency and a factual base, such a position raises more questions than it answers—such

The limo job did something special: it put me at the forefront of an unsolved need that needed a solution. One of my limo clients asked if I knew of any good limo companies in New York. I dropped the passenger off at the airport, but he left me with a seed of invention. If I lived in Chicago and needed prices and booking options for limo service in New York, where would I go to find it? I didn't have a New York Yellow Pages handy, and surely no one outside of New York did either. Faced with this question, I concluded that other travelers would have the same challenge. So, I built a website that would solve this problem. Within a few weeks, LimousinesOnline.com was born.

Chapter Summary: Fastlane Distinctions A first-class ticket to the Sidewalk is to have no financial plan. The Sidewalk’s natural gravitational pull is poverty, both in time and money. You cannot solve poor financial management with more money. You can be income rich and still ride the Sidewalk dirty. Lifestyle Servitude on the Sidewalk grows from excess consumption seeded by instant gratification, image management, and debt. If wealth is defined by income and debt, wealth is an illusion because it is vulnerable to potholes, detours, and “bumps in the road.” When the income disappears, so does the illusion of wealth. Poor financial management is like gambling; the house eventually wins.

if you want to make the most efficient gains, training has to be challenging, and it has to get harder over time. Just being difficult does not, however, make a stimulus specific.

Tension also has its limits—lifting at the heaviest end of the loading range is not the best choice for growth either. Too heavy a load, despite producing a great deal of tension, accumulates a great deal of fatigue and prevents sufficient volume, our next important stimulator of hypertrophy12.

You can get more growth by increasing the tension (via increasing the load), increasing the duration of tension application (the volume), or some combination of both. In simple terms, to cause more muscle growth, you either need to lift heavier (up to a point), do more total sets and reps (up to a point), or some combination of both.

He told me that many magicians would look at the audience and say to themselves, “Well, there’s a bunch of suckers out there; I’ll fool them, all right.” Thurston’s viewpoint was totally different. He told me that every time he went on stage he said to himself: “I am grateful because these people come to see me. They make it possible for me to make my living in a very agreeable way. I’m going to give them the very best I possibly can.”

The bottom line: it sounds simplistic and unimportant, but using absolute statements, answers, and questions makes conversation difficult and leads to premature death. (Of the conversation, not the people involved.) A primary rule of thumb for conversation is to make it easy for the other person, which of course makes it easy for you. Absolutes feel like hard work, and conversation—good conversation—should feel like a game, not a chore.

It can be something as simple as raising your eyebrow and saying, “Oh,” or even just nodding. Small acknowledgements like these should not be underrated. You don’t have to be an expert at reacting, or make a big show of it; you just need to let the other person know you’re engaged.

If you have a problem with reacting too quickly or overreacting, try the two-second rule. Wait two seconds after the person is done speaking before you say anything. It makes it look as if you are processing and considering what they’ve just said. Moreover, people are likely to perceive you as smarter if you take a few moments to respond.
